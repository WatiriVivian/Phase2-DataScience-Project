# Project overview

This is a sample  project that focuses on analyzing the King County House Sales dataset  to provide accurate predictions of house prices. The analysis aims to assist real estate agents in making informed decisions and providing expert advice to their clients in the King County area.

The objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features, such as the number of bedrooms, condition, grade,location etc

# Business Problem

The real estate market is a dynamic and complex sector influenced by various economic, demographic, and societal factors. The challenge at hand is to develop a solution that accurately predicts house prices in King County. By leveraging the relationships between different features of a house and its sale price, the goal is to provide real estate agents with the tools they need to make informed decisions.

Accurate price predictions are essential for real estate agents to assess whether a property is appropriately priced and to determine a competitive price. With reliable predictions, agents can confidently advise their clients, helping them make strategic choices regarding buying, selling, or investing in properties. The outcome of this project directly supports real estate agents in offering expert guidance and ensuring optimal outcomes for their clients.

By applying multi linear regression  and analyzing the King County housing dataset, we aim to uncover the significant factors that drive house prices. This analysis will enable real estate agents to navigate the intricacies of the local market and provide accurate pricing recommendations. Ultimately, the project seeks to empower real estate agents with the insights necessary to excel in their profession, optimize their decision-making processes, and deliver exceptional value to their clients.

# Dataset & Data Understanding

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset which can be found in kc_house_data.csv in the data folder in this GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in column_names.md in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

For this analysis, we worked with the following columns and dropped the rest:

We dropped duplicate data from columns using the 'Id' column.

We dropped rows with missing data from the columns we used.

We transformed the the "  " column from categorical to numerical using ordinal encoding.


# Methology

The analysis utilizes multiple linear regression, a powerful statistical technique, to identify the significant factors that contribute to house prices in the King County area. By examining the relationships between the independent variables (house features) and the dependent variable (sale price), the model generates predictions that can be used to guide pricing strategies and inform buying or selling decisions.
